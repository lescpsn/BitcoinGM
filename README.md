## What is Bitcoin GM?

Bitcoin GM is a hard fork of Bitcoin blockchain to enable users to mine bitcoins and send transactions with Chinese cryptographic algorithms and standards including SM2/SM3/SM4. Users can use off-the-shelf USB tokens as hardware wallet to protect the coins. The Bitcoin GM is also confirmed with national blockchain standards and specifciations.

## Features

 - The Chinese SM2 signature algorithm replaces the ECDSA signature for wallets, which makes your existing USB tokens from banks can be used as your hardware Bitcoin GM wallets.
 - Bitcoin GM adopts the SM3 hash function as Proof-of-Work algorithm, miners can accelerate the mining with their existing high-speed cryptographic devices.
